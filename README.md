📌 Project Description

"Guess My Number!" is a small interactive game where the player has to guess a secret number between 1 and 20.
The player starts with a score of 20.
Each wrong guess decreases the score by 1.
The game provides feedback whether the guess is too high or too low.
When the player guesses correctly, the background changes and the secret number is revealed.
A high score is stored for the session.
The player can restart the game at any time by clicking the Again! button.

🧑‍💻 What I Learned
✅ How to build an interactive web game using Vanilla JavaScript
✅ DOM manipulation — selecting elements, reading values, and updating text and styles dynamically
✅ Handling events with addEventListener and responding to user actions
✅ Using functions for cleaner and reusable code (displayMessage helper function)
✅ Working with random numbers and basic game logic
✅ Managing game state with variables like score, secretNumber, and highscore

⚙️ Challenges Solved
✅ Fixed bugs related to wrong or empty input values
✅ Handled cases when the player loses the game
✅ Improved code readability by refactoring repeated code into functions
✅ Updated the UI dynamically for better player feedback (messages, colors, element sizes)
